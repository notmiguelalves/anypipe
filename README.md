`TODO : add banners for qualification / release pipeline status`

Portable pipelines with minimal dependencies.

### Why?
After some (*a lot of*) frustrations trying to use Dagger.io in production environments with strict security policies, decided to try and make something with minimal dependencies and requirements.

`Let's see if it actually turns out that way :)`

### How?
Essentially a wrapper around Docker's Golang API. Meaning only dependency **should** be having a running docker/podman daemon, and permissions to talk to it.

### Examples
**TODO**

### Contributing
**TODO**

### Open Sourceness
**TODO** add the thing that checks if you use any non-opensource dependencies.
